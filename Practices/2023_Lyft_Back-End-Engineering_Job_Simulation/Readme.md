# Lyft Back-End Engineering Job Simulation Program (Forage)

Forage is a platform that provides company-endrosed programs which simulates the work culture in that company and how do engineers there work on real projects. Lyft's program simulates refactoring an internal app that checks if a car meets the necessary requirements to get maintainence service.

Topics Introduced: Python / OOP / TDD

## Task 1

Building a UML for refactoring [messy code](https://github.com/vagabond-systems/forage-lyft-starter-repo). The diagram followed Composition_over_Inheritance principle in OOP.

### 1st Attempt
Advantages:
* Car objects can be created using any parts available.
Disadvantages:
* No default options for out-of-factory cars.

### 2nd Attempt
Notes after reading the model answer:
* Mis-interpreted that UML can visualize a software lifecycle (like workflows) but in a more generalized way.
* Redo'ed the UML to implement both my & Model_Answer structures.

#### I'm going to stick with the Model_Answer UML for other tasks checklisting

## Task 2
