Program that uses matplotlib to visualize some computer graphics drawing algorithm. The project was intended to my college as an assignment.

I mainly focused on some clean code principles, decoupling every algorithm to its own function. There might be some bugs in some algorithms tho, as I haven't tested edge cases other than the required for the assignment.
